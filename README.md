# WaterMark
This project is a SRTP(Students Reserach Training Project) in SEU(Southeast University) which is aiming at to estimate some algorithms using in filed of image watermark.
In this project, There are three algorithms implements with Matlab, and they are LSB,DWT&LSB,DWT&SVD. Then based on the performance, DWT&SVD is choosed to be implemented as a Android App.

This project is still a demo which has simple function to embed a 2^n*2^n watermark into a 2^n*2^n host picture. We will get a embeded picture that contain the information of watermark, however it's hard to detect the differencewith with eyes before and after embeding.
